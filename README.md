# BandcampMultiSearch
Python script for searching multiple tags on Bandcamp.

Note: This only searches using whatever is found directly on the Bandcamp tag pages. This script does not look into Bandcamp's databases so not every album will be included in the match.

Currently only works with two tags. I'll add an update that takes as many tags as you want sometime.

Required:
- Python 3
- BeautifulSoup 4
	- Install using "pip install beautifulsoup4" or "easy_install beautifulsoup4"
